# PASSWORD ATTACKS
Password attacks are a common and critical aspect of cybersecurity, and they come in various forms. Here's an overview of the most widely known types of password attacks:

## Authentication
* Something you know (a password, passcode, pin, etc.).
* Something you have (an ID Card, security key, or other MFA tools).
* Something you are (your physical self, username, email address, or other identifiers.)

# Credential Storage
## 1. Linux
```
// password list
cat /etc/shadow
y$j9T$3QSBB6CbHEu...SNIP...f8Ms:18955:0:99999:7:::


// uername list
cat /etc/passwd
...SNIP...
htb-student:x:1000:1000:,,,:/home/htb-student:/bin/bash
```
